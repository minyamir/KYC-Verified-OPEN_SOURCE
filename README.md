# AI Worker - Face Verification Service(## fast api)

## Overview

This service verifies whether the face shown in a user's selfie video matches the face shown on the front image of their National ID card.

The system performs:

1. Face extraction from National ID image
2. Face extraction from video frames
3. Face embedding generation
4. Face similarity comparison
5. Basic liveness detection
6. Verification result generation

# Verification Workflow

Step 1

User uploads:

* National ID front image
* 8–10 second selfie video

↓

Step 2

Extract face from ID image

↓

Step 3

Extract frames from video

↓

Step 4

Detect face in video frames

↓

Step 5

Generate face embeddings

↓

Step 6

Compare embeddings

↓

Step 7

Run liveness detection

↓

Step 8

Generate result

---

# Similarity Calculation

The system compares:

```text
ID Face Embedding
vs
Video Face Embedding
```

Using:

```text
Cosine Similarity
```

Formula:

similarity = cosine(id_embedding, video_embedding)

---

# Thresholds

Recommended:

```python
FACE_MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.60
```

Results:

```text
0.80 - 1.00  Very Strong Match

0.70 - 0.79  Strong Match

0.60 - 0.69  Acceptable Match

Below 0.60  Reject
```

---

# Example Response

Successful verification:

```json
{
  "match": true,
  "similarity": 0.6594,
  "liveness": true
}
```

Rejected verification:

```json
{
  "match": false,
  "similarity": 0.45,
  "liveness": true
}
```

---

# API Endpoint

## Verify Identity

Method:

```http
POST /verify
```

Form Data:

| Field    | Type |
| -------- | ---- |
| id_image | File |
| video    | File |

Example:

```text
National_ID.jpg
Selfie_Video.mp4
```

Response:

```json
{
  "match": true,
  "similarity": 0.6594,
  "liveness": true
}
```
